## Gravitational Force


*** =instructions
Jack is now standing at an altitude anywhere on Earth, where gravitational force is not 9.81 m/s^2. Please use the function called gForce that takes an integer called "height" in its parameter. Then, use the equation (G * m * M) / height^2 to return the value of g.

- G = 6.674 * 10^-11

- m = 8

- M = 5.972 * 10^24

- g = (G * m * M) / height^2

Additionally, if we want to print out the value of g,
we have to call the function "gForce" in a print statement.
However, the variable type of g doesn't seem to fit into the print statement.

Please change the variable type of the result of gForce in the print statement.

*** =hint
- Power can be calculated with x1**x2 or math.pow(x1, x2).

For example, 2**3 and math.pow(2, 3) both equal to 8.

- To change a variable type into a string type, put the variable inside str().

For example, to change x = 6 into a string, type str(x).

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# Something is needed here to use math functions.

# gForce has been defined for you, now fill in the following.
def gForce(___):
    G = ___
    m = 8
    M = ___
    g = ___
    return g
    
# Fill in the underlined area with a specific code, so the variable type of gForce() fits into the print statement.
print (___(gForce(10000000)))
```

*** =solution
```{python}
# Something is needed here to use math functions.
import math

# gForce has been defined for you, now fill in the following.
def gForce(height):
    G = 6.674 * math.pow(10, -11)
    m = 8
    M = 5.972 * math.pow(10, 24)
    g = (G * m * M) / math.pow(height, 2)
    return g
    
print(str(gForce(10000000)))

## Pendulum Time Period


*** =instructions
While at the same location, Jack happens to have a pendulum in his pocket, so he wants to measure the time needed for the pendulum to complete 1 period. Please create a function called "timePeriod" that takes in 2 parameters: "length" and "height".

Then, use the equation T = 2π * √(length / g)  to return the value of T in timePeriod.

- T = 2π * √(length / g)

- √ = square root

- MUST use python MATH FUNCTIONS!

*** =hint
- Call the gForce function to find the value of g.

- Use math.pi for π.

- Use math.sqrt(x) for square root.

# gForce is given for you to solve this problem
def gForce(height):

    m = 8
    M = 5.972 * math.pow(10, 24)
    g = (G * m * M) / math.pow(height, 2)
    return g
    
# Create the function timePeriod here


# Function call - no need to change this
print(str(timePeriod(0.5, 10000000)))
```

def gForce(height):
    G = 6.674 * math.pow(10, -11)

    g = (G * m * M) / math.pow(height, 2)
    return g

# Create the function timePeriod here
def timePeriod(length, height):
    T = 2 * math.pi * math.sqrt(length/gForce(height))
    return T

print(str(timePeriod(0.5, 10000000)))
